            <h2>What is volleyball?</h2>

            <p>
                &nbspVolleyball is a game where 6 players are on each side of a 7 foot 11 net, for Men's volleyball, or a
                seven foot four net for womens play.
                It is a sport you can play in every environment, inside or outside! The game of volleyball has evolved
                into many variations of the game.
                &nbspFrom the game's inception in the indoor gym to variations such as four-man games to beach volleyball,
                even snow volleyball is a thing.
                There are many different ways to play volleyball and there are many different leagues to learn
                volleyball in.

            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>
                &nbspVolleyball has played a major part in my life and it has taught me valuable lessons.
                For the seven years I have played this game I have never gotten bored of it.
                I would recommend everyone play it at least once in their life.
