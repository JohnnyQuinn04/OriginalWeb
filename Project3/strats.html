            There are many different strategies, plays, ways of conveying those strategies to your teammates.
            <h2><strong> Hand signals</strong></h2>
            <p>There are many different Hand signals used in volleyball. Hand signals are used to convey the plan
                between the setter and the hitters. You want to use hand signals so the other
                team does not know what you are about to do. There are 3 main rules when creating a hand signal to use.
                You need to be able to see the different hand signals, for example having one
                signal be a gun on your hand and the other having a three. The differences in the hand signals are
                important to practice with your teammates because not every hand signal means the same play will happen.
            </p>
            <p>For starters a simple play would be for the middle, a simple 1 ball. The setter will always try to begin
                on the right of the center of the court on the net. The ball is set about
                a foot above the net to let the middle hit the ball quickly before it falls below the net and before the
                opponents can react. As shown in the picture below the one ball is meant
                to be hit quickly as it does not have any arc to it. The signal for this hit is to just put up a one.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>The “normal” outside attack is a five ball. It is a lofty throw to give the outside attacker enough time
                to rotate from serving or defending to his hitting approach. This gives
                the outside that extra second to think where he/she is going to hit it, making it deadly, but also
                predictable.</p>
            <p>This is where the more complex plays come into play. A setter showing a fist means a play called a
                “stack”. The middle attacker goes up for an attack but also has the outside player
                following behind, giving the attack more players in one spot. This in turn causes confusion and missed
                timing for the opponents to block. More complex plays are just like football
                plays where you don't want the opponent to know what way the ball is going and not give the opponent any
                time to react.</p>
            <p>Another semi complex play is the shoot. A shot in all simplicity is an extremely fast set to the outside
                position. It is shown in the diagram as a light blue line. Although this play
                may seem simple at first, the timing between the setter and their outside needs to be on point. Through
                many hours of practice this is perfected.</p>
