            <h2>What is volleyball?</h2>

            <p>
                Volleyball is a game where 6 players are on each side of a 7 foot 11 net, for Men's volleyball, or a
                seven foot four net for womens play.
                It is a sport you can play in every environment, inside or outside! The game of volleyball has evolved
                into many variations of the game.
                From the game's inception in the indoor gym to variations such as four-man games to beach volleyball,
                even snow volleyball is a thing.
                There are many different ways to play volleyball and there are many different leagues to learn
                volleyball in.

            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Volleyball has played a major part in my life and it has taught me valuable lessons.
                For the seven years I have played this game I have never gotten bored of it.
                I would recommend everyone play it at least once in their life.
